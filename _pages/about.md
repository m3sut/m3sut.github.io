This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Political Science and Public Administration at [Adana Alparslan Türkeş Science and Technology University]([http: ](https://www.atu.edu.tr/) in Turkey. I hold a Ph.D. in Urban Affairs and Public Policy, as well as an M.P.A. in Public Administration, both from the University of Delaware, where I also served as a teaching and research assistant. Since 2022, I have been a Senior Fellow at the University of Delaware’s Institute for Public Administration.

Prior to my graduate studies in the United States, I earned my undergraduate degree in Political Science and Public Administration from Kocaeli University (2006–2011). I also pursued graduate-level coursework in Administrative Sciences at Ankara University’s Faculty of Political Sciences (2012–2014), which helped strengthen my foundation in public policy and governance.

My research and teaching focus on public policy, public administration, cybersecurity, and democratic governance. I am particularly interested in how technology shapes public management and how state and local governments respond to emerging cybersecurity challenges.

I have contributed to research projects funded by U.S. public institutions such as the Delaware Department of Transportation and have presented my work at international conferences and in peer-reviewed journals. My recent research examines state-level cybersecurity policies in the United States, the privatization of public spaces, environmental governance, and data breach issues.

This website includes information on my research, publications, teaching activities, and academic background.

Feel free to reach out at mkarakoc@atu.edu.tr. I welcome questions, collaborations, and new ideas!
